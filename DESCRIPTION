Description: Multivariate hypothesis tests and the confidence intervals. It can be used to test the hypothesizes about mean vector or vectors (one-sample, two independent samples, paired samples), covariance matrix (one or more matrices), and the correlation matrix. Moreover, it can be used for robust Hotelling T^2 test at one sample case in high dimensional data. For this package, we have benefited from the studies Rencher (2003), Nel and Merwe (1986) <DOI: 10.1080/03610928608829342>, Tatlidil (1996), Tsagris (2014), Villasenor Alva and Estrada (2009) <DOI: 10.1080/03610920802474465>.
